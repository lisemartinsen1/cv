# CV Portfolio App

A simple portfolio web application built using Spring Boot, deployed on Render.
It showcases coding projects, links to social profiles and includes a 
contact form for demonstration purposes. Although the form is functional, 
it is not intended for real-world use, as this is a hobby project and not a professional CV.
